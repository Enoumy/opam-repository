synopsis: "Hardcaml wrappers for Xilinx memory primitives"
description: "
The Hardcaml_xilinx library provides wrappers for Xilinx specific RAM and FIFO primitive
blocks. In many cases a simulation model is provided.

The `Synthesis` module implements various arithmetic and logical RTL components with
Xilinx LUT primitives.
