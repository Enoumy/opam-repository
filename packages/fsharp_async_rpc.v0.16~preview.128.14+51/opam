synopsis: "Reimplementation of our async_rpc library in F#"
description: "
This library reimplements async_rpc and is used for building RPC-style protocols which can communicate with OCaml RPC servers.

Our F# projects use relative paths for project references. It is likely that these will
need to be modified depending on your directory structure. [fsharp_async_rpc] has dependencies to two of our open source projects, [fsharp_core_kernel] and [fsharp_bin_prot].
