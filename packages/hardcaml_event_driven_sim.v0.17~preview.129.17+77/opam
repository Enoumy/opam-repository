synopsis: "Hardcaml Event Driven Simulator"
description: "
Event driven simulation for Hardcaml designs.

The kernel library exposes a simulator modelled after VHDL simulation semantics.

The main library provides means to convert a Hardcaml design into an event driven
simulation model and write testbenches against it.
