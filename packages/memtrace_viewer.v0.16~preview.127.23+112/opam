synopsis: "Interactive memory profiler based on Memtrace"
description: "
Processes traces produced by the Memtrace library and displays the
top allocators in a table or flame graph. To help find space leaks,
events can be filtered by lifetime, showing only allocations of
objects that are still live at peak memory usage.
