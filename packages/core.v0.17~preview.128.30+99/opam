synopsis: "Industrial strength alternative to OCaml's standard library"
description: "
The Core suite of libraries is an industrial strength alternative to
OCaml's standard library that was developed by Jane Street, the
largest industrial user of OCaml.

This is the system-independent part of Core. Unix-specific parts were moved to [core_unix].
