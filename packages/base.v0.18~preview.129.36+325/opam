Full standard library replacement for OCaml

Base is a complete and portable alternative to the OCaml standard
library. It provides all standard functionalities one would expect
from a language standard library. It uses consistent conventions
across all of its module.

Base aims to be usable in any context. As a result system dependent
features such as I/O are not offered by Base. They are instead
provided by companion libraries such as stdio:
