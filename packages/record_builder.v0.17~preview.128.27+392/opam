synopsis: "A library which provides traversal of records with an applicative"
description: "
This is a very small library which utilises the functionality provided by the
=ppx_fields= syntax extension, more specifically it acts as a wrapper to the
derived =Fields.make_creator= function for a given record type. The wrapper
automatically handles all of the mapping and combining of applicative terms
needed to build the record from a single applicative term for each field.
