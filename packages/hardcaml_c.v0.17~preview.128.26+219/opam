synopsis: "Hardcaml C Simulation Backend"
description: "
A fast C-based simulation backend for Hardcaml circuits.

The library transparently compiles a Hardcaml Circuit to C code, which is in turn compiled
and linked into the running executable. The generated simulation object can be used like
any other cyclesim simulation.
