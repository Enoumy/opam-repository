synopsis: "OCaml/async implementation of the postgres protocol (i.e., does not use C-bindings to libpq)"
description: "
postgres_async is an OCaml PostgreSQL client that implements the PostgreSQL 
protocol rather than binding to the libpq C library. It provides support for 
regular queries (including support for 'parameters': \"SELECT * WHERE a = $1\")
and COPY IN mode. The interface presented is minimal to keep the library simple
for now, though in the future a layer on top may add convenience functions.
