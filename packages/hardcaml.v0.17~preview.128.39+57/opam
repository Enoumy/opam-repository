synopsis: "RTL Hardware Design in OCaml"
description: "
Hardcaml is an embedded DSL for designing and simulating hardware in OCaml.
Generic hardware designs are easily expressed using features such as higher
order functions, lists, maps etc.  A built in simulator allows designs to
be simulated within Hardcaml.  Designs are converted to either Verilog or
VHDL to interact with standard back end tooling.
